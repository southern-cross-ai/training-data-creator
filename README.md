This repository is intended to preserve the code used to collect the training data for the Southern Cross LLM. It is currently a work-in-progress.

## Sources
Provided below is a breakdown of potential open data sources by their size, quality, diversity and ease of scraping.
| Source                       | Size  | Quality | Diversity | Ease of Access | Priority       |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Open Australian Legal Corpus | Large | High    | Low       | Extremely easy | Extremely high |

| data.gov.au                  | Large | Medium  | High      | Very difficult | Medium         |

Possible sizes are extremely large (≥1M documents), very large (≥500k), large (≥100k), medium (≥50k), small (≥10k), very small (≥5k) and extremely small (<5k).

Possible qualities, diversities and priorities are extremely high, very high, medium, low, very low and extremely low.

Possible eases of access are extremely easy (requires no effort to transform into the desired format), very easy (little effort required), somewhat easy (some effort required), difficult (requires substantial effort required), very difficult (large amount of effort required) and extremely difficult (extreme amount of effort required).

Feel free to update this table with other suggested open data sources.
